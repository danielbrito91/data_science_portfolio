## Personal projects
### Machine Learning

- [Cyanobacteria monitoring](https://github.com/danielbrito91/cyanobacteria-monitoring): First, to increase the volume of data, I extracted data from Google Earth Engine API and trained a machine learning model to measure the cyanobacteria concentration of Guaíba Lake using the health surveillance data as the target.

_Tools: Python: Google Earth Engine, Pandas, XGBoost, scikit-learn, streamlit, DVC, AWS S3_

- [Fantano doesn’t like to dance - a classification model on Needle Drop’s reviews](https://danielbrito.me/post/2021-07-24-fantano-doesn-t-like-to-dance-a-classification-model-on-needle-drop-s-reviews/): A classification model to predict if an album reviewed by The Needle Drop would get a high score.

_Tools: R, Python, tidyverse, reticulate, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Spotipy_

### Flask
